# Git Starter Guide

Welcome to the Git Starter Guide! This document provides you with the essential information you need to get started with Git, a powerful version control system. Whether you're new to Git or looking for a quick reference, you're in the right place.

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in files and collaborate on software development projects. It allows you to:

- Keep a history of changes made to your code.
- Work on projects collaboratively with others.
- Easily switch between different versions of your project.
- Safeguard your work and recover from mistakes.

## Installation

To begin using Git, you need to install it on your computer. You can download Git for various platforms from the official website: [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

After installation, open your terminal or command prompt and run `git --version` to verify that Git is installed correctly.

## Configuration

Before using Git, it's a good idea to set your name and email address, which will be associated with your commits. Use the following commands to configure Git:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
```
